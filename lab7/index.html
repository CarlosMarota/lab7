                    Sign up to go Mars on NASA trip to Mars application page. <strong>The spacecraft departs Earth at a
                        speed of about 24,600 mph (about 39,600 kph). The trip to Mars will take about seven months and
                        about 300 million miles. </strong>

                <p>
                    As the Perseverance rover explores Mars, scientists identify promising rock targets. They especially
                    look for rocks that formed in, or were altered by, water. Water is key to life as we know it. Such
                    rocks are even more interesting if they have organic molecules, the carbon-based chemical building
                    blocks of life. Some special types of rocks can preserve chemical traces of life over billions of
                    years. Finding rocks that formed in water, have the chemical building blocks of life, and can
                    preserve signs of organics and life is key. Together, they improve the chances of finding ancient
                    traces of microbial life on Mars, if any ever existed. In addition to these special rocks,
                    Perseverance also collects volcanic and other rocks to help establish a record of geologic and
                    environmental changes over time.
